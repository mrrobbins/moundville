						<h3>The Environment</h3>
						<p>Located in Moundville, Alabama, the Moundville Archeological Park 
                        is one of the greatest 
						resources of archeological data on Native Americans and 
						as such has a wonderful collection of priceless artifacts. 
						In fact, there are so many artifacts that there is a great 
						demand for the ability to display and disseminate information 
						about the historical significance of this site to the general 
						public. This coupled with the desire for an immersive educational 
						experience has created a need for a new perspective on the 
						museum experience, both for the indoor museum exhibits and 
						the experience of the outdoor park.</p>
						<p>This proposed system will address the education concerns 
						of the Moundville Archeological Park by embracing smartphone 
						technology as a way to provide an innovative and engaging 
						experience to visitors. Such an immersive educational experience 
						will provide the museum with a modern outlet for educating 
						the public and allowing the visitors to view archeology 
						in a new and exciting way.</p>
						<h3>System Outline</h3>
						<p>The general structure of the system has two main domains, 
						a mobile application for the visitors of the park and a 
						web portal for the administrative purposes of updating and 
						maintaining the data made available to the visitors. Both 
						domains focus on the end goal of providing visitors access 
						to information about artifacts written in concise articles 
						with photographs or artistic renderings. The mobile application 
						can also be thought of as three main methods or experiences 
						with which visitors can interact with the park.</p>
						<h3>Administrative Portal</h3>
						<p>The main focus of the administrative portal is as a method 
						of updating and maintaining a catalog of articles on major 
						sites or artifacts. The administrator would access this 
						portal through a web browser and use it to view current 
						articles, add new articles, edit existing articles, and 
						delete articles if needed. Other additional uses of the 
						portal will be to update locations of specific sites or 
						where artifacts were discovered by interacting with a map 
						of the park and printing out QR codes for articles to be 
						placed at exhibit locations.</p>
						<h3>Mobile Application in General</h3>
						<p>A mobile application will be developed for visitors to 
						download onto their Android smartphone by scanning a QR 
						code displayed in the museum. This application will open 
						onto a “splash screen” which will display a general welcome 
						message and give the user a menu of three separate experiences 
						to choose from. These experiences are listed “Scan an Exhibit 
						Item”, “Park Map”, and “Discoveries Near Me”.</p>
						<h3>Scan an Exhibition Item</h3>
						<p>A simple method for interacting with exhibits, this experience 
						will allow a visitor to scan a QR code which will bring 
						up the article associated with that exhibit.</p>
						<h3>Park Map</h3>
						<p>Using a custom Google Map, this experience will pull 
						up the map of the park on the visitor’s smartphone. Pins 
						placed on the map through the Administrator Portal will 
						populate the map. Visitors can then hover over the pins 
						to display titles of the locations and click on the pins 
						to bring up the article associated with the location.</p>
						<h3>Discoveries Near Me</h3>
						<p>While outside viewing the mounds, a visitor can use this 
						experience to pull up a list of articles related to their 
						current location. This experience will populate a list of 
						artifacts, sites, and related photographs or artistic renderings 
						for the visitor to browse through. When a visitor clicks 
						on an item in the list, this action will bring up the associated 
						article. This list will show only artifacts and sites associated 
						with the visitor’s immediate location, within a predetermined 
						area.</p>
